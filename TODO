TODO:
☐ Add unit testing
☐ Migrate from react-semantify to stardust
☐ Clean up wepack.config.js


TESTING:
✔ Figure out a way to move redux form out of components to containers @done(2016-08-01 08:52)
  ✔ Move modal back to header @done(2016-08-01 08:45)
  ✔ Email/password error props @done(2016-08-01 08:52)
✔ Hopefully this makes components stateless and will allow us to shallow render @done(2016-08-01 09:19)
☐ As for stateful containers, we can possibly use a global describe in tests.webpack.js
  to preload an ApolloProvider to mount all other containers to.
